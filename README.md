# Customer-Segmentation
INTRODUCTION
Customer segmentation is the practice of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals that are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests and spending habits.
Companies employing customer segmentation operate under the fact that every customer is different and that their marketing efforts would be better served if they target specific, smaller groups with messages that those consumers would find relevant and lead them to buy something. Companies also hope to gain a deeper understanding of their customers' preferences and needs with the idea of discovering what each segment finds most valuable to more accurately tailor marketing materials toward that segment.
Customer segmentation relies on identifying key differentiators that divide customers into groups that can be targeted. Information such as a customers' demographics (age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, education level), geography (where they live and work), psychographic (social class, lifestyle and personality characteristics) and behavioral (spending, consumption, usage and desired benefits) tendencies are taken into account when determining customer segmentation practices.
Benefits of customer segmentation include:
1.	Personalisation
      •	Personalisation ensures that you provide exceptional customer experience.
2.	Customer Retention
      •	It is 16 times as costly to build a long-term business relationship with a new customer than simply to cultivate the loyalty of an existing customer.
3.	Better ROI for marketing
      •	Affirmations that right marketing messages are sent to the right people based on their life cycle stage.
4.	Reveal new opportunities
      •	Customer segmentation may reveal new trends about products and it may even give the first mover’s advantage in a product segment.

GOAL
The goal of the project is to identify segments of customers to target the potential user base. They divide customers into groups according to common characteristics like gender, age, interests, and spending habits so they can market to each group effectively.
K-means clustering is used to visualize the gender and age distributions. And analyzed their annual incomes and spending scores.

CONCLUSION
The generated "Customer Segmentation based on Annual Income and Spending Score" plot shows the distribution of the 4 clusters. 
Having a better understanding of the customers segments, a company could make better and more informed decisions.  A more strategic and targeted marketing approach could lift their interest and make them become higher spenders. The focus should also be on the "loyal" customers and maintain their satisfaction.
Hence, it would be helpful for the organization for identifying the distinct group of customers that increases the profit. It also help them in maintaining customer relationship and customer retention by executing different marketing strategies
